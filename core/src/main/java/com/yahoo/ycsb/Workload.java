 * One experiment scenario. One object of this type will
 * be instantiated and shared among all client threads. This class
 * should be constructed using a no-argument constructor, so we can
 * load it dynamically. Any argument-based initialization should be
 * done by init().
 * 
 * If you extend this class, you should support the "insertstart" property. This
 * allows the Client to proceed from multiple clients on different machines, in case
 * the client is the bottleneck. For example, if we want to load 1 million records from
 * 2 machines, the first machine should have insertstart=0 and the second insertstart=500000. Additionally,
 * the "insertcount" property, which is interpreted by Client, can be used to tell each instance of the
 * client how many inserts to do. In the example above, both clients should have insertcount=500000.
