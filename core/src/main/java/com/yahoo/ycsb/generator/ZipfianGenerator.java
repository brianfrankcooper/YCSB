/**
 * A generator of a zipfian distribution. It produces a sequence of items, such that some items are more popular than
 * others, according to a zipfian distribution. When you construct an instance of this class, you specify the number
 * of items in the set to draw from, either by specifying an itemcount (so that the sequence is of items from 0 to
 * itemcount-1) or by specifying a min and a max (so that the sequence is of items from min to max inclusive). After
 * you construct the instance, you can change the number of items by calling nextInt(itemcount) or nextLong(itemcount).
 *
 * Note that the popular items will be clustered together, e.g. item 0 is the most popular, item 1 the second most
 * popular, and so on (or min is the most popular, min+1 the next most popular, etc.) If you don't want this clustering,
 * and instead want the popular items scattered throughout the item space, then use ScrambledZipfianGenerator instead.
 *
 * Be aware: initializing this generator may take a long time if there are lots of items to choose from (e.g. over a
 * minute for 100 million objects). This is because certain mathematical values need to be computed to properly
 * generate a zipfian skew, and one of those values (zeta) is a sum sequence from 1 to n, where n is the itemcount.
 * Note that if you increase the number of items in the set, we can compute a new zeta incrementally, so it should be
 * fast unless you have added millions of items. However, if you decrease the number of items, we recompute zeta from
 * scratch, so this can take a long time.
 *
 * The algorithm used here is from "Quickly Generating Billion-Record Synthetic Databases", Jim Gray et al, SIGMOD 1994.

   * this code will incrementally compute a new zeta value for the larger itemcount. However, if you decrease the
   * number of items, the code computes zeta from scratch; this is expensive for large itemsets.
   * Usually this is not intentional; e.g. one thread thinks the number of items is 1001 and calls "nextLong()" with
   * that item count; then another thread who thinks the number of items is 1000 calls nextLong() with itemcount=1000
   * triggering the expensive recomputation. (It is expensive for 100 million items, not really for 1000 items.) Why
   * did the second thread think there were only 1000 items? maybe it read the item count before the first thread
   * incremented it. So this flag allows you to say if you really do want that recomputation. If true, then the code
   * will recompute zeta if the itemcount goes down. If false, the code will assume itemcount only goes up, and never
   * recompute.
