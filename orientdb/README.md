## Quick Start

This section describes how to run YCSB on OrientDB running locally. 

### 1. Set Up YCSB

Clone the YCSB git repository and compile:

    git clone https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB.git
    cd YCSB
    mvn clean package

### 2. Run YCSB
    
Now you are ready to run! First, load the data:

    ./bin/ycsb load orientdb -s -P workloads/workloada

Then, run the workload:

    ./bin/ycsb run orientdb -s -P workloads/workloada

See the next section for the list of configuration parameters for OrientDB.

## DB creation with the OrientDBClient
This client will create a database for you if the connection database you specify does not exists. You can also specify connection information to a preexisting database.

You can use the ```orientdb.newdb=true``` property to allow this client to drop and create a new database instance during the ```load``` phase.

NOTE: understand that using the ```orientdb.newdb=true``` property will drop and recreate databases even if it was a preexisting instance.

WARNING: Creating a new database will be done safely with multiple threads on a single YCSB instance, but is not guaranteed to work when launching multiple YCSB instances. In that scenario it is suggested that you create the db before hand, or run the ```load``` phase with a single YCSB instance.

## OrientDB Configuration Parameters

* ```orientdb.url``` - (required) The address to your database.
    * Supported storage types: memory, plocal, remote
    * EX. ```plocal:/path/to/database```
    * remote EX. ```remote:172.16.50.15:2424/database```
* ```orientdb.user``` - The user to connect to the database with.
    * Default: ```admin```
* ```orientdb.password``` - The password to connect to the database with.
    * Default: ```admin```
* ```orientdb.newdb``` - Overwrite the database if it already exists.
    * Only effects the ```load``` phase.
    * Default: ```false```
* ```orientdb.remote.storagetype``` - Storage type of the database on remote server
    * This is only required if using a ```remote:``` connection url

## Known Issues

* There is a performance issue around the scan operation. This binding uses OIndex.iterateEntriesMajor() which will return unnecessarily large iterators. This has a performance impact as the recordcount goes up. There are ideas in the works to fix it, track it here: [#568](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/issues/568).
* Iterator methods needed to perform scans are Unsupported in the OrientDB API for remote database connections and so will return NOT_IMPLEMENTED status if attempted.
