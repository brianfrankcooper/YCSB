## Quick Start

This section describes how to run YCSB on ElasticSearch running locally. 

### 1. Set Up YCSB

Clone the YCSB git repository and compile:

    git clone [put YCSB git repository URL]
    cd YCSB
    mvn clean package

### 2. Run YCSB
    
Now you are ready to run! First, load the data:

    ./bin/ycsb load elasticsearch -s -P workloads/workloada

Then, run the workload:

    ./bin/ycsb run elasticsearch -s -P workloads/workloada

For further configuration see below: 

### Defaults Configuration
The default setting for the ElasticSearch node that is created is as follows:

    cluster.name=es.ycsb.cluster
    node.local=true
    path.data=$TEMP_DIR/esdata
    discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled=false
    index.mapping._id.indexed=true
    index.gateway.type=none
    gateway.type=none
    index.number_of_shards=1
    index.number_of_replicas=0
    es.index.key=es.ycsb

### Custom Configuration
If you wish to customize the settings used to create the ElasticSerach node
you can created a new property file that contains your desired ElasticSearch 
node settings and pass it in via the parameter to 'bin/ycsb' script. Note that 
the default properties will be kept if you don't explicitly overwrite them.

Assuming that we have a properties file named "myproperties.data" that contains 
custom ElasticSearch node configuration you can execute the following to
pass it into the ElasticSearch client:


    ./bin/ycsb run elasticsearch -P workloads/workloada -P myproperties.data -s


If you wish to use a in-memory store type rather than the default disk store add 
the following properties to your custom properties file. For a large number of 
insert operations insure that you have sufficient memory on your test system 
otherwise you will run out of memory.

    index.store.type=memory
    index.store.fs.memory.enabled=true
    cache.memory.small_buffer_size=4mb
    cache.memory.large_cache_size=1024mb

If you wish to change the default index name you can set the following property:

    es.index.key=my_index_key
