## Quick Start

This section describes how to run YCSB on RocksDB running locally (within the same JVM).
NOTE: RocksDB is an embedded database and so articles like [How to run in parallel](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload-in-Parallel) are not applicable here.

### 1. Set Up YCSB

Clone the YCSB git repository and compile:

    git clone https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB.git
    cd YCSB
    mvn clean package

### 2. Run YCSB

Now you are ready to run! First, load the data:

    ./bin/ycsb load rocksdb -s -P workloads/workloada -p rocksdb.dir=/tmp/ycsb-rocksdb-data

Then, run the workload:

    ./bin/ycsb run rocksdb -s -P workloads/workloada -p rocksdb.dir=/tmp/ycsb-rocksdb-data

## RocksDB Configuration Parameters

* ```rocksdb.dir``` - (required) A path to a folder to hold the RocksDB data files.
    * EX. ```/tmp/ycsb-rocksdb-data```
