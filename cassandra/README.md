# Apache Cassandra >= 2.1 CQL binding

Binding for [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org), using the CQL API
via the [DataStax driver](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.17/manual/index.html)

To run against the (deprecated) Cassandra Thrift API, use the `cassandra-10` binding.

## Creating a table for use with YCSB

For keyspace `ycsb`, table `usertable`, noting you should apply your own replication,
compaction and other settings based on your testing configuration.
```sql
CREATE KEYSPACE ycsb WITH REPLICATION = {
    'class' : 'SimpleStrategy',
    'replication_factor': 3
};
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE ycsb.usertable (
    y_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    field0 VARCHAR,
    field1 VARCHAR,
    field2 VARCHAR,
    field3 VARCHAR,
    field4 VARCHAR,
    field5 VARCHAR,
    field6 VARCHAR,
    field7 VARCHAR,
    field8 VARCHAR,
    field9 VARCHAR
);
```

**Note that parameters like `replication_factor`, `compaction` etc. will affect performance.**

## Cassandra Configuration Parameters

* `cassandra.driverconfig` (**required**)
  * Path to a HOCON configuration for configuring the Cassandra driver.
  * See the reference configuration here <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.17/manual/core/configuration/reference/index.html>.

* `cassandra.driverprofile.<operation>`
  * `<operation>` is one of `read`, `scan`, `insert`, `update` or `delete`.
  * Defaults to anonymous global profile.
  * Profile within the driver config to use for a specific operation.
  * Driver configs have an anonymous config that all profiles inherit from (and you can modify this), which is used by default if this parameter is not specified.

* `cassandra.tracing.<operation>`
  * `<operation>` is one of `read`, `scan`, `insert`, `update` or `delete`.
  * Default is `false`.
  * Captures detailed information about the internal operations performed by all nodes in the cluster in order to build the response.
  * This is an expensive operation and should only be done on a few queries, adjusted by `cassandra.tracingfrequency`.

* `cassandra.tracingfrequency.<operation>`
  * `<operation>` is one of `read`, `scan`, `insert`, `update` or `delete`.
  * Default is `1000`.
  * Determines how often tracing will be performed, i.e. for every `n` queries, tracing will be enabled on that query.
