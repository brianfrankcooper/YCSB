# Graph databases benchmark
# Graphworkload A: Evenly distributed operations
#   Application example: Mainly used for testing.
#
#   Default data size: 500 Byte records (value of Node will be filled with 500 random bytes)

# Initial inserts in load phase
recordcount=1000

# Operations executed during run phase
operationcount=1000

# Workload class to use, should be GraphWorkload for graph databases
workload=com.yahoo.ycsb.workloads.GraphWorkload

# Only insert nodes, no edges. Can be used to determine performance difference between operations on nodes and edges.
onlynodes=false

# Directory where the generated dataset will be stored for future usage.
datasetdirectory=/tmp/datasetForBenchmarks

# Number of bytes to store in each node as the value of the node.
fieldlength=500

# How many graph components should be scanned in the scan operation.
maxscanlength=1000

# Parameters to modify width of the dataset tree on different levels. See GraphDataRecorder::createGraph() for implementation.

# Distribution of operations in the run phase.
