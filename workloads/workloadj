# Workload Template: Default Values
#
# File contains all properties that can be set to define a
# YCSB session. All properties are set to their default
# value if one exists. If not, the property is commented
# out. When a property has a finite number of settings,
# the default is enabled and the alternates are shown in
# comments below it.

# Use of most explained through comments in Client.java or
# CoreWorkload.java or on the YCSB wiki page:

# How the latency measurements are presented
# measurementtype=histogram
#measurementtype=timeseries
#measurementtype=raw
# When measurementtype is set to raw, measurements will be output
# as RAW datapoints in the following csv format:
# "operation, timestamp of the measurement, latency in us"
#
# Raw datapoints are collected in-memory while the test is running. Each
# data point consumes about 50 bytes (including java object overhead).
# For a typical run of 1 million to 10 million operations, this should
# fit into memory most of the time. If you plan to do 100s of millions of
# operations per run, consider provisioning a machine with larger RAM when using
# the RAW measurement type, or split the run into multiple runs.
#
# Optionally, you can specify an output file to save raw datapoints.
# Otherwise, raw datapoints will be written to stdout.
# The output file will be appended to if it already exists, otherwise
# a new output file will be created.

# Latency reporting.
#
# YCSB records latency of failed operations separately from successful ones.
# Latency of all OK operations will be reported under their operation name,
# such as [READ], [UPDATE], etc.
#
# For failed operations:
# By default we don't track latency numbers of specific error status.
# We just report latency of all failed operation under one measurement name
# such as [READ-FAILED]. But optionally, user can configure to have either:
# 1. Record and report latency for each and every error status code by
#    setting reportLatencyForEachError to true, or
# 2. Record and report latency for a select set of error status codes by
#    providing a CSV list of Status codes via the "latencytrackederrors"
#    property.
# reportlatencyforeacherror=false
# latencytrackederrors="<comma separated strings of error codes>"

# Insertion error retry for the core workload.
#
# By default, the YCSB core workload does not retry any operations.
# However, during the load process, if any insertion fails, the entire
# load process is terminated.
# If a user desires to have more robust behavior during this phase, they can
# enable retry for insertion by setting the following property to a positive
# number.
# core_workload_insertion_retry_limit = 0
#
# the following number controls the interval between retries (in seconds):
# core_workload_insertion_retry_interval = 3
