# Workload Defintion: DevOps Monitoring Workload 2 (DMW2)
#
# This workload was created as part of a bachelor thesis
# at the Technical University of Berlin, by Michael Smart
# https://github.com/smartygus
#
# Data to load as basis:
#
# This workload uses a server monitoring scenario, and
# in particular this scenario is based around CPU utilisation
# metrics.
# There are 20000 time series, each with one week of
# data at 15 second intervals.
# We are using a fixed starting time stamp representing
# 1/2/2020 at midnight.
# This amounts to a total of:
# 20000 (time series) * 4 (points per minute) * 60 (minutes in an hours) *
#       24 (hours in a day) * 7 days = 806400000 records
#
# Each time series has four tags:
#
# - app: the application that the particular host is performing a role for
# - cmp: what component of the app the host is (ie. what role), eg. web server,
#        appliation server, database server, etc.
# - host: the name or ID of the host, unique only within the context of the first
#         two tags
# - mode: which mode the CPU utilisation metric refers to, eg. user, system, idle
#         and so-on.
#
# Run phase of the workload:
#
# There is 1 SCAN query and 1 INSERT query that make up the
# run phase of the workload. The INSERT query models
# the ongoing stream of incoming metrics.
#
# The idea behind this workload is that of a monitoring
# dashboard that displays a graphical representation of the
# aggregate CPU utilisation for all hosts for an app, grouped
# by component.
# The time window is 30 minutes for the SCAN
# query, because this aggregate-level utilisation view is mainly
# intended to identify short-term swings in the overall load of the
# app that might imply the need to add more hosts for example.
#
# The approximate "real-world" request rate for this
# workload is 1333/requests per second, based on the
# idea that there are 2 apps in our dataset, and the
# dashboard view for each app would be updated 4 times
# per minute (ie. as every new data point from each
# host came in).
# One could set this as the target rate for a workload 
# measuring latency for example.
# For a 20-minute benchmark run that would give
# and operation count of around 1.6 million for example.
# To measure throughput just experiment with
# higher and higher target throughputs until
# the throughput achieved by the system under test
# does not increase anymore, then do a full
# benchmark run at a target rate slightly higher
# than the maximum throughput.
