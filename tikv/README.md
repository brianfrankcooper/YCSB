# TiKV Client for YCSB
A Test for TiKV's Java Client

## How to build
First build the latest TiKV Java Client from [repo](https://github.com/tikv/client-java).

Then build the YCSB project with following commands.

```commandline
mvn -pl site.ycsb:tikv-binding -am clean package
```

## How to run

The generated ycsb tar is located in `/path-to-repo/tikv/target/ycsb-tikv-binding-0.18.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz`

The following command starts a ycsb workload.

```commandline
tar -xvf /path-to-tar/ycsb-tikv-binding-0.18.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
cd ./ycsb-tikv-binding-0.18.0-SNAPSHOT
./bin/ycsb.sh [run/load] tikv -s [-threads <thread-num>] [-P <tikv-properties-file>] [-P <path-to-workload>]
```

e.g.,

```
./bin/ycsb.sh run tikv -s 20 -P ./tikv.properties -P ./workload/workloada
```
