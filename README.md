Getting Started
---------------

1. Download the [latest release of YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/latest):

    ```sh
    curl -O --location https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/releases/download/0.17.0/ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz
    tar xfvz ycsb-0.17.0.tar.gz
    cd ycsb-0.17.0
    ```
    
2. Set up a database to benchmark. There is a README file under each binding 
   directory.

3. Run YCSB command. 

    On Linux:
    ```sh
    bin/ycsb.sh load basic -P workloads/workloada
    bin/ycsb.sh run basic -P workloads/workloada
    ```

    On Windows:
    ```bat
    bin/ycsb.bat load basic -P workloads\workloada
    bin/ycsb.bat run basic -P workloads\workloada
    ```

  Running the `ycsb` command without any argument will print the usage. 
   
  See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload
  for a detailed documentation on how to run a workload.

  See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Properties for 
  the list of available workload properties.


Building from source
--------------------

YCSB requires the use of Maven 3; if you use Maven 2, you may see [errors
such as these](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/issues/406).

To build the full distribution, with all database bindings:

    mvn clean package

To build a single database binding:

    mvn -pl site.ycsb:mongodb-binding -am clean package
