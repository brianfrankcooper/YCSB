FAQs
* Why is the recommended workload distribution set to 'uniform'?
    This is to conform with the best practices for using DynamoDB - uniform,
evenly distributed workload is the recommended pattern for scaling and
getting predictable performance out of DynamoDB

http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/BestPractices.html

* How does workload size affect provisioned throughput?
    The default payload size requires double the provisioned throughput to execute
the workload. This translates to double the provisioned throughput cost for testing. 
The default item size in YCSB are 1000 bytes plus metadata overhead, which makes the 
item exceed 1024 bytes. DynamoDB charges one capacity unit per 1024 bytes for read 
or writes. An item that is greater than 1024 bytes but less than or equal to 2048 bytes 
would cost 2 capacity units. With the change in payload size, each request would cost 
1 capacity unit as opposed to 2, saving the cost of running the benchmark.

* How to identify throttling?
    Unless you have disabled logging, when you exceeded your provisioned throughput
limit you will receive "configured provisioned throughput for the table was exceeded" error 
message. The request is then retried by the DynamoDB plugin, and the latency measured by 
YCSB is increased. Check Cloudwatch for ThrottledRequests, and increase the provisioned
throughput of the table as needed or adjust the number of YCSB client threads
