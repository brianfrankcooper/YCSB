# YCSB Memcached binding

This section describes how to run YCSB on memcached.

## 1. Install and start memcached service on the host(s)

Debian / Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install memcached

RedHat / CentOS:

    sudo yum install memcached

## 2. Install Java and Maven

See step 2 in [`../mongodb/README.md`](../mongodb/README.md).

## 3. Set up YCSB

Git clone YCSB and compile:

    git clone http://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB.git
    cd YCSB
    mvn -pl com.yahoo.ycsb:memcached-binding -am clean package

## 4. Load data and run tests

Load the data:

    ./bin/ycsb load memcached -s -P workloads/workloada > outputLoad.txt

Run the workload test:

    ./bin/ycsb run memcached -s -P workloads/workloada > outputRun.txt

## 5. memcached Connection Parameters

A sample configuration is provided in
[`conf/memcached.properties`](conf/memcached.properties).

### Required params

- `memcached.hosts`

  This is a comma-separated list of hosts providing the memcached interface.
  You can use IPs or hostnames. The port is optional and defaults to the
  memcached standard port of `11211` if not specified.

### Optional params

- `memcached.shutdownTimeoutMillis`

  Shutdown timeout in milliseconds.

- `memcached.objectExpirationTime`

  Object expiration time for memcached; defaults to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

- `memcached.checkOperationStatus`

  Whether to verify the success of each operation; defaults to true.

- `memcached.readBufferSize`

  Read buffer size, in bytes.

- `memcached.opTimeoutMillis`

  Operation timeout, in milliseconds.

- `memcached.failureMode`

  What to do with failures; this is one of `net.spy.memcached.FailureMode` enum
  values, which are currently: `Redistribute`, `Retry`, or `Cancel`.

You can set properties on the command line via `-p`, e.g.:

    ./bin/ycsb load memcached -s -P workloads/workloada \
        -p "memcached.hosts=127.0.0.1" > outputLoad.txt
