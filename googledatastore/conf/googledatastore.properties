# Google Cloud Datastore's read and update APIs do not support
# reading or updating a select subset of properties for an entity.
# (as of version v1beta2-rev1-3.0.2)
# Therefore, it's recommended that you set writeallfields and readallfields
# to true to get stable and comparable performance numbers.

# EVENTUAL, STRONG (default is STRONG)
#
# googledatastore.readConsistency=STRONG

# Decides how we group entities into entity groups. 
# (See the details section in README.md for documentation)
#
# googledatastore.entityGroupingMode=ONE_ENTITY_PER_GROUP

# If you set the googledatastore.entityGroupingMode property to 
# MULTI_ENTITY_PER_GROUP, you can optionally specify the name of the root entity
#

# Strongly recommended to set to uniform.
# requestdistribution = uniform
