## Quick Start

This section describes how to run YCSB on [Apache Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org).

### 1. Set Up YCSB

Git clone YCSB and compile:

    git clone http://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB.git
    cd YCSB
    mvn -pl com.yahoo.ycsb:ignite-binding -am clean package

### 2. Start Apache Ignite
1.1 Download latest binary [Apache Ignite release](https://ignite.apache.org/download.cgi#binaries)

1.2 Start ignite nodes using apache-ignite-fabric-2.6.0-bin/bin/**ignite.sh** ignite.xml

1.3 Copy YCSB/ignite/target/ignite-binding-0.16.0-SNAPSHOT.jar to apache-ignite-fabric-2.6.0-bin/libs

Note: Please use YCSB/ignite/resources/**ignite.xml** for running **IgniteClient** tests and **ignite-sql.xml** for
**IgniteSqlClient** tests. Pay attention that some parameters such us **storagePath**, ****_walPath_****, ****_walArchivePath_****
should be overwritten by certain pathes. Also please add ip addresses of your host inside the bean **TcpDiscoveryVmIpFinder**

More information about Apache Ignite WAL (Write Ahead Log): https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/write-ahead-log
### 3. Load Data and Run Tests

Load the data:

    .bin/ycsb load ignite -p hosts="10.0.0.1"
        -s -P workloads/workloada \
        -threads 4 \
        -p operationcount=100000 \
        -p recordcount=100000 \
         > outputload.txt
Note: '10.0.0.1' is ip address of one of hosts where was started Apache Ignite nodes.

Run the workload test with ignite:

    .bin/ycsb run ignite -p hosts="10.0.0.1"
         -s -P workloads/workloada \
         -threads 4 \
         -p operationcount=100000 \
         -p recordcount=100000 \
          > outputload.txt

Run the workload test with ignite-sql:

    .bin/ycsb run ignite-sql -p hosts="10.0.0.1"
         -s -P workloads/workloada \
         -threads 4 \
         -p operationcount=100000 \
         -p recordcount=100000 \
          > outputload.txt
