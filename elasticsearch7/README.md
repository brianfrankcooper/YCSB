## Quick Start

This section describes how to run YCSB on Elasticsearch 7.x running locally. 

### 1. Install and Start Elasticsearch

[Download and install Elasticsearch][1]. When starting Elasticsearch, you should
[configure][2] the cluster name to be `es.ycsb.cluster` (see below).

### 2. Set Up YCSB

Clone the YCSB git repository and compile:

    git clone git://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB.git
    cd YCSB
    mvn clean package

### 3. Run YCSB
    
Now you are ready to run! First, load the data:

    ./bin/ycsb load elasticsearch7 -s -P workloads/workloada

Then, run the workload:

    ./bin/ycsb run elasticsearch7 -s -P workloads/workloada

The Elasticsearch 7 binding requires a standalone instance of Elasticsearch.
You must specify a hosts list for the transport client to connect to via
`-p es.hosts.list=<hostname1:port1>,...,<hostnamen:portn>`:

    ./bin/ycsb run elasticsearch5 -s -P workloads/workloada \
    -p es.hosts.list=<hostname1:port1>,...,<hostnamen:portn>`

Note that `es.hosts.list` defaults to `localhost:9300`. For further
configuration see below:

### Defaults Configuration
The default setting for the Elasticsearch node that is created is as follows:

    es.setting.cluster.name=es.ycsb.cluster
    es.index.key=es.ycsb
    es.number_of_shards=1
    es.number_of_replicas=0
    es.new_index=false
    es.hosts.list=localhost:9300

### Custom Configuration
If you wish to customize the settings used to create the Elasticsearch node
you can created a new property file that contains your desired Elasticsearch 
node settings and pass it in via the parameter to 'bin/ycsb' script. Note that 
the default properties will be kept if you don't explicitly overwrite them.

Assuming that we have a properties file named "myproperties.data" that contains 
custom Elasticsearch node configuration you can execute the following to
pass it into the Elasticsearch client:

    ./bin/ycsb run elasticsearch7 -P workloads/workloada -P myproperties.data -s

If you wish to change the default index name you can set the following property:

    es.index.key=my_index_key

By default this will use localhost:9300 as a seed node to discover the cluster.
You can also specify

    es.hosts.list=(\w+:\d+)+

(a comma-separated list of host/port pairs) to change this.

### Configuring the transport client

The `elasticsearch7` binding starts a transport client to connect to
Elasticsearch using the transport protocol. You can pass arbitrary settings to
this instance by using properties with the prefix `es.setting.` followed by any
valid Elasticsearch setting. For example, assuming that you started your
Elasticsearch node with the cluster name `my-elasticsearch-cluster`, you would
need to configure the transport client to use the same cluster name via

    ./bin/ycsb run elasticsearch7 -P <workload> \
    -p es.setting.cluster.name=my-elasticsearch-cluster
    
### Using the Elasticsearch low-level REST client

The Elasticsearch 7 bindings also ship with an implementation that uses the
low-level Elasticsearch REST client. The name of this binding is
`elasticsearch-rest`. For example:

    ./bin/ycsb load elasticsearch7-rest -P workloads/workloada
    
You can configure the hosts to connect to via the same `es.hosts.list` property
used to configure the transport client in the `elasticsearch7` binding (note
that by default you should use port 9200)
