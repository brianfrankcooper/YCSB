## Quick Start

This section describes how to run YCSB with Sparksee. 

### 1. Set Up YCSB with Sparksee

Clone the YCSB git repository and compile:

    git clone git://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB.git
    cd YCSB
    mvn -pl com.yahoo.ycsb:sparksee-binding -am clean package

### 2. Run YCSB with Sparksee
    
Now you are ready to run! First, load the data:

    ./bin/ycsb load sparksee -s -P workloads/workloada -p sparksee.path=/my/path/to/db.gdb

Then, run the workload:

    ./bin/ycsb run sparksee -s -P workloads/workloada -p sparksee.path=/my/path/to/db.gdb

For further configuration see below: 

### Default Configuration Parameters
The default settings for Sparksee are as follows:
	
- `sparksee.path`
  - This sets the path for the database **file**. 
    - The file has to have the ending `.gdb`.
    - If you specify a path with folders, those folders have to exist. The client will only create the file in the 
    folder if needed.
  - Default: `sparkseeDB.gdb`
    - This file will be created in the current directory.

- `sparksee.logLevel`
  - This sets the log level for the sparksee client.
  - Available values are:
    - `Off`
    - `Info`
    - `Fine`
    - `Warning`
    - `Debug`
    - `Severe`
    - `Config`
  - Default: `Off`
